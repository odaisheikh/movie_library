									Movies library
 

Overview:
The main idea of the website is to show different kinds of movies in categories and to give the visitor the ability to visit the site, as well as give the logged-in user the ability to like, comment, and rank the existing movies. The user can also add a movie to his watch list in order to see it later, and the user can also add new movies to the site, but it goes through a process where the admin must accept the movie before adding it to the site. What makes our site unique is that users can add movies to the website, which makes it a highly interactive website.
